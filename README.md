Boilerplate for JavaScript-powered Utilities

### Synopsis
everywhere.js is a collection of JavaScript boilerplate repositiories which
exist to provide an immediate entry point to development whenever inspiration
strikes. The goal of the project is to provide a boilerplate repository for
every (reasonable) platform that JavaScript runs on. The concept behind each
repository is to have a near-zero startup time, but also act as a blank
canvas.

This repository provides the bare minimum setup for a modern node app. It's
general usecase is for non-GUI microservices, prototyping, and command line
tasks.
